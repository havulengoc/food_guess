# Visual Recognition for Vietnamese Foods

## Description
In this application, I crawled 6000 images from using Bing Image Search API and trained ResNet-50 model with 94% accuracy over 11 classes. When one puts in an image of a popular Vietnamese dish, the app will give the guess for its name and provide its description.
